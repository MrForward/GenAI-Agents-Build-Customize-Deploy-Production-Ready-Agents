## 🤖 What is an Agent?

An AI agent is a system that can perceive, reason, and act to achieve goals. In practice, production agents combine:

- **Memory**: short-term (scratchpad) + long-term (vector store)
- **Tools**: web/search, code execution, databases, integrations (Slack, Notion, Gmail, Stripe)
- **Planning**: task decomposition, reflection, guardrails
- **Policy**: prompts, constraints, role definitions, and evaluation
- **Orchestration**: queues, retries, timeouts, tracing, and observability

**Architecture layers in this repo:**

1. Interface (CLI, API, Web UI) → 2) Orchestrator (state machine) → 3) Reasoning (LLM + prompts) → 4) Tools/Skills → 5) Memory/Knowledge → 6) Infra (auth, logging, billing)
