## What is an "Agent"?

An *AI Agent* is an autonomous or semi-autonomous program that uses LLMs, external tools, and state (memory) to complete complex goals. Agents combine:

* **Orchestration** — how steps & tools are scheduled
* **Tools** — APIs, browser automation, databases
* **Memory** — short & long-term context (vectors, KV)
* **Evaluation** — tests, metrics, human-in-the-loop checks

Use this repo to move from a single-file prototype to a production-ready agent with guardrails, monitoring, and deployability.

---

## Definitions & Tutorial

### Key definitions

* **Tool**: Any external capability (search, calculator, API) the model calls.
* **Memory**: Persistent state (short-term vs long-term).
* **RAG**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation — retrieval + LLM to ground answers.
* **Orchestrator**: Component that maps goals → steps → tools.

### 20-minute Tutorial: "Hello Agent"

1. Install: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Populate `.env` with an LLM key and a vector DB URL (we provide a free Redis example).
3. Run `python demos/hello_agent.py` — this demo shows: prompt → planner → tool call → memory write → response.

**Files used**: `demos/hello_agent.py`, `agents/planner.py`, `tools/web_search.py`, `memory/redis_memory.py`.

## Top Agent Ideas (with MVP and monetization)

1. **Research Assistant** — Summarize & track topics. MVP: Slack bot that returns 1-paragraph summaries & sources. Monetize: SaaS subscriptions for teams.
2. **Sales Outreach Agent** — Autogenerated, personalized outreach sequences. MVP: CSV upload → 5 tailored emails. Monetize: pay-per-month + templates marketplace.
3. **Recruiting Screen Agent** — Screens resumes, does initial question set. MVP: Email integration + scorecard. Monetize: per-seat pricing.
4. **Code Review & PR Assistant** — Auto-suggests test cases and refactors. MVP: GitHub Action commenting on PRs. Monetize: enterprise integrations.
5. **Customer Support Triage Agent** — Classify & propose replies, route to human. MVP: Zendesk/Intercom integration. Monetize: SLA-based pricing.
6. **Compliance Assistant** — Monitor docs and highlight risky language. MVP: Doc scanner + issue generator. Monetize: compliance add-on for legal teams.
7. **Meeting Summarizer & Action-Item Manager** — Integrates with calendar & transcriptions. Monetize: team subscription.
8. **Personal Finance Planner** — Aggregates bank CSVs, suggests budgets. Monetize: premium features.
9. **Marketing Copy Generator + A/B Tester** — Generates multi-variant copies, reports expected lift. Monetize: pay-per-report.
10. **Localization & Transcreation Agent** — High-quality cultural translations for marketing assets. Monetize: per-word pricing + enterprise API.

For each idea include: `examples/` (end-to-end demo), `notebooks/` (walkthrough), `deploy/` (one-click deploy manifest).

## Prompt & Portfolio Templates (LinkedIn / GitHub)

### LinkedIn Post Structure (Technical / Viral)

1. **Hook (1 line)** — Surprising fact or direct question. Example: `We built an AI agent that actually finishes tasks — not just answers questions.`
2. **What I built (1–2 lines)** — Short, outcome-focused.
3. **Why it matters (2–3 bullets)** — Real metrics or user anecdotes.
4. **Mini demo / GIF** — 5–10s GIF showing the agent.
5. **Call to action** — `Repo link` + `Star if you want more tutorials` + `Comment "demo" to get the Colab`.

**Example LinkedIn post**

> Hook: `Stop wasting time re-reading long threads.`
>
> I built a Meeting Assistant that ingests your Zoom transcript and returns a 90-second action plan. In 100 test meetings it reduced follow-up time by 42%.
>
> Demo GIF below — try it live: [Colab link]
>
> If this helps your team, star the repo and comment `demo` for the Colab.

### GitHub Portfolio Blurb

* Short one‑liner + 1–2 screenshots/GIFs. Add a `Try in Colab` badge and `Deploy to Replit`/`Run in Codespaces` if possible.
