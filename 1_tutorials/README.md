## 💡 Usage Tips

### For Beginners
1. **Follow the order** - Tutorials build on each other
2. **Type the code yourself** - Don't just copy-paste; understanding comes from doing
3. **Experiment** - Try modifying examples to see what happens
4. **Ask questions** - Use [GitHub Discussions](../../../discussions) if you get stuck

### For Experienced Developers
- Feel free to jump to specific tutorials that interest you
- Check the "Advanced Patterns" sections in each tutorial
- Explore the [templates folder](../2_templates/) for production-ready code
- Contribute your own patterns and improvements!

### Best Practices
- ⚡ **Start simple** - Get basic versions working before adding complexity
- 🧪 **Test incrementally** - Validate each component before combining
- 📝 **Document learnings** - Keep notes on what works and what doesn't
- 🔄 **Iterate** - Agents improve through experimentation
