## 🚀 How to Use These Ideas

1) Pick a niche and user you can reach this week  
2) Build the MVP—optimize for speed, not polish  
3) Run 5–10 user demos, log objections and must-haves  
4) Ship the smallest fix that converts an early customer  
5) Add observability (logs/metrics) before scaling

Pro tip: Record 60–90s demo GIFs and include them in your README. Ship fast, show value, iterate.
